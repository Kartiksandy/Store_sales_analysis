## Predictive Analysis Exercise: Store Sales

This project involves performing time series analysis and forecasting on store sales data. The goal is to build predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data. The notebook utilizes statistical methods to decompose, analyze, and predict sales trends.

### Project Overview:

1. **Objective:**
   - The primary goal is to forecast future store sales using historical sales data, focusing on furniture and office supplies categories.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - **Time Series Plot:** The historical sales data is visualized to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the dataset.

3. **Model Building:**
   - **ARIMA Model:** 
     - An ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is built to forecast sales based on the identified trends and patterns in the historical data.
   - **Model Diagnostics:** 
     - Diagnostic plots are generated to investigate any unusual behavior and validate the model assumptions.

4. **Model Validation and Forecasting:**
   - **One-Step Ahead Forecast:** 
     - The model's performance is validated by comparing the forecasted values with the actual sales data.

5. **Comparison of Sales Categories:**
   - **Sales Comparison Plot:**
     - A comparison plot of furniture and office supplies sales is generated to analyze the differences and similarities in sales trends between the two categories.
